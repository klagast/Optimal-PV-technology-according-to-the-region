# Calculations
There are different calculation Python files. What they each do is listed below.
## Filter_cities
This file is to filter nearby cities from 42432 cities to 3596 cities.
## Function_elevation
This is the function to calculate the elevation for every city around the world with the help of an API.
## Function_haversine_formula
This is the file to measure the distance between two coordinates with the Haversine formula.
## Function_optimal_solar_panel_tilt
This the file to calculate the optimal tilt angle of a PV module on any place on Earth. Based on a research of the Stanford University.
## Function_that_returns_energy_yield_everytimestamp
This is the file that calculates the DC energy yield every hour for a chosen location and PV module.
## Function_that_returns_energy_yield_for_nmpy
This is the file that calculates the yearly DC energy yield, the yearly DC energy yield divided by the surface area of the PV module and the yearly DC energy yield divided by the watt-peak of the PV module for a chosen location and PV module.
## Make_energy_yield_table
This is the file to add the 3 forms of energy yield to a table called dc_results for every city.
## Map_create_with_all_cities
This is the file to create a world map with all the used cities in this research.
## Tmy_cities_add_to_database
This is the file to download the Typical Meteorological Year from PVGIS for every city and store this locally in a table called tmy_cities.
