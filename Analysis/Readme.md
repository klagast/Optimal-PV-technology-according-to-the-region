# Analysis
There are different analysis Python files. What they each do is listed below.
## Analysis3maps
This file is able to create worldmaps with the best PV technology in the cities for the yearly DC energy yield, for the yearly DC energy yield per square meter and for the yearly DC energy yield divided by the watt-peak.
## Analysisselectiontop10panels
This is the file to add the top 10 best modules for each city to the database top10panelscities_2.
## Cities_clustered
This is the file to make boxplost of the 6 PV weather parameters for the 8 clusters of cities.
## Clusters
These are the steps followed in the data analysis chapter to divide the cities with the help of cluster analysis in 8 groups.
## Final_results_table
This is the file to add, for the most representative cities in the 8 clusters, their results in the final_results_2 table.
## Final_results_table_pearson_module_parameters
File to make the heatmap of the Pearson correlations between the dc_power_wpeak and each of the module parameters from the final_results_2 table.
## Final_results_table_pearson_weather_parameters
File to make the heatmap of the Pearson correlations between the dc_power and each of the weather parameters from the Typical Meteorological Year table.
## Piechartmaterials
Making of the piechart of the used materials in the Sandia Module Database.
## Table_creating_map_dc_results
File to make the the 3 seperate tables with the cumulative weights for the top10 best modules.
## Weather_average_each_city
File to add the average weather data to the database weather_average_each_city to afterwards be able to start the cluster analysis.
